            Thank you for your feedback on the Basics of Information and Knowledge Management course implementation. All students took their time to write feedback, which I am really grateful for! 

Mainly the course got positive feedback, and the positive atmosphere and energy we will try to maintain.

The main points of improvements requested in the feedback were a new course book and lecture slides made available earlier. Since the course will in the future be offered as an online course, the slide matter will be different. I will also continue my search in looking for a better course book. Your feedback regarding the assignment will be valuable when designing a new assignment for the online course.

Some students thanked the practical examples and others said the course was too theoretical. I will try my best to better balance theoretical information and practical examples in the future implementations, so that the course will give both, theoretical knowledge and ideas on how the theory is applied in practice.

           The possibility to learn at own pace was possible through the lecture slides. Doing an assignment for it has been highly beneficial as it allowed phrasing the main content in our own words helping us to remember them and as well as improving our understanding through application. Allowing us to bring hand written notes in the exam also helps us organise and filter our knowledge making going back to it later on much easier.
